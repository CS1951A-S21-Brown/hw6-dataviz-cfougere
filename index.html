    <p>1. My dashboard answers the following questions: what genres have the most titles, what does content duration look lke across time for movies and tv shows, and what does a network of actors connected by their work look like.
    </p>
    <p>2. D3 was helpful in that it allowed for a lot of customization, it helped me access data points one by one, and the graphs available through D3 are suitable for almost any dataset/data question.</p>
    <p>3. D3 is definitely difficult to learn and therefore not accessible to beginners. D3 can also get convoluted pretty quickly if there are underlying data issues. Lastly, D3 print statements (in the console) aren't always that interpretable.</p>
    <p>4. This dashboard is definitely not as accessible for color-blind users, a consideration I saw only after building it in theme.</p>
